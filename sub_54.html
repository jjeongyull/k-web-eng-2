              The One Essential
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              You Only Need One (YONO) embodies a new value system focusing on singling out one thing that truly matters to oneself.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              The rise of this trend is closely tied to the fatigue from the overabundance of choice offered in modern life. In a world overflowing with online shopping options, social media content, and cultural experiences, people are experiencing the “paradox of choice,” where more options actually lead to diminished satisfaction.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              YONO also suggests a new direction for personal relationships. It promotes minimizing unnecessary encounters and shallow connections to focus on meaningful relationships. YONO is proving to be more than just a trend, but is emerging as a guiding philosophy for redefining modern life. As we live increasingly competitive lives, where choices involve more complexity, the message of finding fulfillment in “the one” may not only support personal happiness, but also contribute to efficiencies that benefit the environment as well as society at large.

              Active Seniors Taking Hold of the Aging Era
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              Active seniors refer to individuals aged 60 and above who actively enjoy healthy lifestyles, financial independence, and leisure. In a rapidly aging South Korea, active seniors are establishing themselves as a crucial pillar of society and the economy.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              Notable examples include Mak-rye Park, who began her career as a YouTube creator at the age of 71, and Chil-doo Kim, who transitioned from running a blood sausage soup restaurant to becoming a senior model at 61. Active seniors are emerging not just as consumers but as economic and cultural drivers.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              The rise of active seniors extends beyond economic impact. They are becoming significant members of society through volunteer work, community leadership, and political participation. In particular, the recent increase in voting rates among those aged 60 and above, along with a rise in communitycentered activities, underscores the social influence of the elderly.

              A New Path to Sustainability
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              The term “climate sensitivity” has gained traction as more people recognize the severity of climate change and its ensuing social and economic crises.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              This heightened awareness shapes consumer behavior. “Eco-friendly” is no longer a passing trend but is becoming a mainstay factor in  consumption, and companies are shifting strategies to align with this new standard. For example, retailers are introducing ecofriendly packaging and labelfree beverages, and the automotive industry is evolving to meet the surge in electric and hydrogen vehicle sales.
            </p>
            <p class="sub-p-text">
              Climate sensitivity has now become a matter of survival rather than choice. If this momentum continues to impact more sectors and individuals, affecting change, Korea may be able to position itself as a global leader in overcoming the climate crisis.

            Finding Happiness in the Ordinary
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Aboha (an abbreviated neologism in Korean meaning, “Just an Ordinary Day”) highlights a lifestyle that values the small joys and stability found in everyday routines as opposed to focusing on special events or grand achievements. This trend emerged as a reaction against a lifestyle that is performancedriven and stimulusheavy. As the “new normal” settled in after the pandemic, people have rediscovered the value of clarifying simplicity of maintaining everyday routines at home.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            Aboha represents more than just a lifestyle change; it also reflects a growing focus on mental wellbeing. Activities such as meditation, walking, and journaling are central to this movement.
          </p>
          <p class="sub-p-text">
            By finding joy in moments of mindfulness, Aboha offers a life philosophy that helps maintain a balanced between oneself and the world.

          Reaching Wider Horizons: The Birth of Pacific Chemical
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Amorepacific began its journey in 1945 under the name Pacific Chemical. Over the decades, it has transformed into a powerhouse in the beauty industry, offering a wide range of brands that resonate with customers worldwide. From prestigious department store lines like Sulwhasoo and HERA to lifestylefocused brands such as LANEIGE, Mamonde, HANYUL, INNISFREE, and ETUDE, Amorepacific has consistently enriched everyday beauty experiences. The company has also achieved remarkable success in the fields of hair and body care, with standout brands like Ryo, LABO-H, illiyoon, HAPPY BATH, and MEDIAN. The origins of this beauty giant trace back to Dok-jeong Yun, the mother of Sung-whan Suh, Amorepacific’s visionary founder. In the 1930s, Yun began crafting camellia hair oil using natural ingredients she meticulously selected herself. Her commitment to delivering trustworthy, highquality products became the foundation for the company’s ethos.<br>
          Inspired by his mother’s dedication, Suh established Pacific Chemical with the ambition of venturing into broader markets. In 1948, the company launched Korea’s first branded cosmetic product, Melody Cream, at a time when unbranded, inferiorquality goods dominated the market. This bold move demonstrated the company’s confidence in its products and signified a promise of quality and accountability. Driven by a desire to create worldclass cosmetics, Suh prioritized technological innovation. In 1954, he established Korea’s first cosmetics research laboratory in a small 6.6squaremeter space at the Huam-dong factory in Seoul. Though modest, this lab became a pioneering force in advancing the science of cosmetics in Korea.

          Forging a Legacy of Firsts
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Amorepacific’s history is marked by a series of groundbreaking achievements. In 1958, it launched Korea’s first monthly beauty magazine, Hwajanggye (The World of Cosmetics), offering women access to beauty trends and tips. In 1961, it opened Korea’s first beauty consultation center, and in 1964, it became the country’s first exporter of cosmetics. The release of ABC Ginseng Cream in 1966 marked a global milestone as the world’s first herbal cosmetic, blending traditional Korean ingredients with modern skincare. From launching Korea’s first makeup campaign, Oh My Love, in 1971 to creating the world’s first green teabased cosmetics with Meero in 1989, the company consistently stayed ahead of the curve. These efforts culminated in a major milestone in 1984, when Amorepacific received the $20 Million Export Tower Award, a testament to its early focus on global markets. The 1990s ushered in a new era of innovation, with the successful introduction of brands such as Mamonde, LANEIGE, ETUDE, HERA, IOPE, Sulwhasoo, and INNISFREE. Each brand brought a unique perspective to the beauty industry, infusing the global cosmetics market with vitality. In 2002, the company embraced a new identity, changing its name from Pacific Chemical to Amorepacific.<br>
          Amorepacific has continuously forged ahead, rewriting the history of global beauty. The company became the world’s first to develop the cushion foundation, a product now used conveniently by people everywhere. Amorepacific’s goal was to create products that were more hydrating and easier to use. After more than 3,600 tests, the innovative sponge and puff were perfected, combined with the groundbreaking CellTrap™ technology that encapsulates nonflowing liquid within a cushion. This innovation led to the launch of the IOPE Air Cushion  in 2008, which sparked a global sensation and transformed beauty standards worldwide.<br>
          Today, Amorepacific operates 16 overseas subsidiaries, catering to the diverse needs of customers around the world. Its commitment to innovation and quality has earned it widespread recognition. In 2015, the company was named one of Forbes’ World’s Most Innovative Companies, and in 2016, it became the first Korean company to rank seventh on the list of Women’s Wear Daily’s Top 100 Beauty Companies.

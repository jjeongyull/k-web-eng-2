          Could you introduce Thomas House?

        <p class="sub-p-text">
          We are a charitable meal distribution center that not only serves visitors meals free-of-charge, but our meals aim to uphold human dignity. For over 30 years, we’ve operated solely on voluntary donations without support from the government or local authorities. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, about 500 people visited daily, though the number now averages around 350. Volunteers prepare meals with warmth and care, ensuring everyone can eat comfortably.

          What inspired you to open Thomas House?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          In the early 1990s, while serving as a parish priest at Gaebongdong Church, I was also in charge of correctional ministry<span class="sub-tool">1</span> at Yeongdeungpo Prison. Around that time, parishioners asked me to operate a free meal center. They explained that exprisoners often relied on such centers for food, but the center previously run by a missionary had to close after the friars were assaulted by visitors. I hesitated initially due to my other duties, but then decided to visit the site myself.<br>
          What I found was a place piled high with garbage, abandoned for over nine months. Seeing the state of the space tugged at my heart, and I thought, “How wonderful it would be to serve a meal to those in need.” That’s when I decided to take action.

          It must have been challenging to open Thomas House under such conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          It was daunting. I had to make nine trips with a handcart to clear the mountain of garbage. Thankfully, the building owner allowed us to use the space for meal services. Using donations collected from the church, I managed to cover the deposit and rent. At first, there were no sponsors, so I even used my own money to purchase meal supplies. Finally, Thomas House opened its doors in February 1993. I recall serving meals to about 120 people daily at the time.

      <div class="sub-page-text-div mb-50">
        <p class="sub-p-title mb-text">
          You must have faced other challenges in the early days.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Financial struggles were the most pressing. There were times when we couldn’t pay rent for several months. Once, I even woke up muttering, “Lord, rice!” in my sleep because we were so short on food.<br>
          Emotionally, it was also difficult. Although we started with good intentions, there were many disheartening incidents. Some visitors spat on the street or fought while waiting in line to be served. The noise during lunchtime drew complaints from local shop owners, who accused us of attracting homeless people and “ruining the neighborhood.” I was even grabbed by the collar multiple times. Despite these hardships, I couldn’t abandon what I had started in the name of my baptismal vow.

          Thomas House has moved three times within Yeongdeungpo District. Any memorable stories you’d like to share?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          At the first location, which had a small space for bathing, we washed people who struggled to care for themselves. Half a bar of soap would disappear after just one bath, but I was glad to help. At the second location, we received help from medical staff at Yeouido St. Mary’s Hospital. For those who couldn’t afford hospital visits, the staff provided checkups and prescriptions, which were more appreciated than even the meals.

          You address visitors with a special term. Can you explain why?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Matthew 25:40 notes, “Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.” This reminds me of the day I decided to open Thomas House. For some, a meal might seem insignificant, but for others, it can be lifesaving. I wanted to provide not just food but also warmth and respect. For this, it was important to meet them as equals, acknowledging our shared humanity. That’s why we call our visitors “Uri Nim” (“Our Loved Ones”), derived from “Our Lord.”<br>
          Surprisingly, this simple change made a significant difference. People who used to spit or curse became noticeably gentler. Some even said they found solace in dining together. They seemed to feel less alone, more part of a collective “we.”

      <div class="sub-page-text-div mb-50">

          Thomas House is now approaching its 32nd anniversary. What has motivated you throughout the years?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Our visitors come to us with diverse stories, carrying burdens of sorrow, anger, despair, and shame. While they may appear unkempt, the volunteers and I focus solely on serving them as fellow human beings. I believe this culture of mutual respect and care enriches Thomas House, drawing people from afar.<br>
          When someone smiles and expresses gratitude after a meal, I see the living Jesus in that smile. I consider it my mission to live a life of love through service.

          How is Thomas House faring today?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Since the pandemic, we’ve seen a broader range of visitors. While most were previously homeless, we now also see many elderly individuals living alone or just above the poverty line.<br>
          In practical terms, the rising cost of living has been challenging. While donations tend to increase during holidays or year-end, overall support has been declining. Even so, we are grateful to pay our rent and bills on time. Occasionally, when we’re on the brink of running out of rice, a helping hand miraculously appears.

          What do you think has sustained Thomas House despite these challenges?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Undoubtedly, God’s grace. This isn’t just as a priest but as an ordinary human being. I mentioned exclaiming “Lord, rice!” in my sleep. However, we have since moved past those tough times. Over the years, many people have stepped up to help. I’d like to express my deepest gratitude to our general secretary Theresa Gyeong-ok Park, and the countless volunteers, including Huiil Jeong, who are driven solely by the sense of fulfillment. They are the ones who work the hardest and stay the closest, never losing their smiles. I’m blessed to have them by my side.

          LG, Rinnai, and others have generously donated various items, and there are also those who help out by volunteering. In September 2024, FKI Chairman Jin Roy Ryu and about 20 employees participated in a mealserving volunteer activity at Thomas House. Do you have a message for volunteers?
        </p>
        <p class="sub-p-text">
          Everything delivered to Thomas House is a tremendous source of strength. From in kind donations and mealserving volunteer work to even a simple word of encouragement, they all carry immense love and the warmth of sharing. I believe it is thanks to the interest and care shown by those who visit and support this place that Thomas House has been able to continue until today. I am deeply grateful for every step taken toward us. Each initial step has inspired new steps, creating a positive cycle that has drawn countless people to Thomas House. I would describe this as the “power of footsteps.”

          In times of hardship, marginalized groups are pushed further aside. But aren’t we all fundamentally the same? I hope for a society where we treat one another without prejudice. Personally, I am thankful for the opportunities in life, and this is echoed in my prayers. My goal is to continue serving at Thomas House until my last breath.

However, the Korea Development Institute (KDI) offered a contrasting assessment in its September Economic Trends report, stating, “Despite strong export growth, the Korean economy is showing signs of constrained improvement, as elevated interest rates are delaying the recovery of domestic demand.”</div>

The construction plan was revived under the Suk-yeol Yoon administration, symbolizing the reversal of the phaseout policy and the revival of the nuclear power industry. The government and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) are determined to accelerate the construction to compensate for “lost time.”</div>

However, this depends on curbing the growth of household debt. Economy and Finance Minister Sang-mok Choi and other key economic officials have noted a slowdown in the rise of household debt, affirming plans to strengthen macroprudential management tools to stabilize the situation.</div>

However, concerns are emerging that exports may have peaked. Factors casting a shadow over the outlook include potential US economic cooling, fears of a slowdown in China’s growth, and uncertainty surrounding the US presidential election in November. Some global investment banks have also warned of a potential “peakout” in South Korea’s export growth rates.</div>

While exports and foreign direct investment (FDI) reached record highs, consumer spending and construction investment remained sluggish. In response, the government convened an Ministerial Meeting on Economic Affairs to announce measures aimed at boosting domestic demand. Key strategies include easing regulations on private sector investments to stimulate the construction industry and forgiving debts for vulnerable groups to support consumer spending.</div>

The inclusion is expected to stabilize interest rates, reduce funding costs for the government and corporations, and improve liquidity in the foreign exchange market.</div>

The central bank lowered the benchmark interest rate by 0.25%p, shifting away from its longstanding tightening stance. The decision was attributed to factors including a drop in the consumer price inflation rate to below 2% last month and a recent slowdown in both housing prices and household debt growth.</div>

This was the first time since records began (in 1963) that the number of female employees exceeded 10 million. Among the 22.027 million total employees in Korea, the ratio of female workers was 46.1%, also the highest on record. There are high hopes that greater female workforce participation will gather momentum, especially as the economically active population is in decline due to low birth rates and aging in Korean society.</div>

With South Korea’s trade with China comprising 23.3% of all Korean trade, which nearly rivals the combined 25.3% Korean trade volume with the United States and Europe, heightened US pressure on China under the Trump administration poses significant risks.</div>
